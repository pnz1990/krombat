# Issue Template

Use this template when creating new GitHub issues:

## Problem
[Describe what's broken or missing]

## Goal
[What should be achieved]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Testing
- [ ] Test case 1
- [ ] Test case 2
- [ ] Test case 3

## Notes

- Important consideration 2

**Guidelines:**
- Keep it concise - no code examples in issues
- Focus on what needs to be done, not how
- Implementation details belong in PRs, not issues
- Use checkboxes for trackable items
